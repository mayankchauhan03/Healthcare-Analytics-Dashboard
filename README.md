# Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard-Power BI


## Project Overview  
This project is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built to analyze patient waitlists, specialties, case types, and age profiles.  

The dashboard provides both a **Summary View** (high-level KPIs & trends) and a **Detailed View** (granular patient data with filters).  

---

## Key Objectives  
- Track **total patient waitlists** across time periods  
- Compare **case types**: Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient  
- Analyze waitlists by **age profile** and **time bands**  
- Identify **Top 5 specialties** with the highest waitlists  
- Monitor **monthly trends** for better healthcare planning  

---
## Insights from the Summary View Dashboard

**1. Waitlist Trend**
- The latest month shows a rise/fall compared to the previous month
- Monthly line chart highlights seasonal fluctuations in waitlist counts.

**2. Case Type Analysis**
- Outpatients account for the largest share of waitlists.
- Day Case and Inpatient numbers are smaller but significant, showing the pressure on specific hospital services.

**3. Age Profile vs Time Band**
- Majority of patients waiting the longest are in the older age groups.
- Younger profiles show shorter waiting times, suggesting prioritization differences.

**4. Top 5 Specialties**
- Certain specialties (e.g., Orthopedics, Cardiology, Ophthalmology – based on your dataset) dominate waitlists.
- These are likely bottleneck departments requiring more staff or resources.
